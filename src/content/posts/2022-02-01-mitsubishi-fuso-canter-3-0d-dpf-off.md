We were called to diagnose a Mitsubishi Fuso Canter with the 4M50-T4 engine, the client's complaint was low power, black smoke and multiple warning lights in the instrument cluster.

Our initial diagnostic revealed fault codes related to DPF soot content being full, even after a regeneration the regeneration did not work as the DPF core was damaged and required replacement.

The owner was informed of our diagnostic and upon researching the cost of a new DPF, he decided to eliminate the DPF system as a whole.

We removed the engine control unit for a safe bench remapping.

After remapping the DPF off the ECU and adding 10% more power, we installed the control unit back on the truck, and the truck's power was restored with additional 10% power and DPF free.

The client was filled with joy with the truck's power restored and increased.
