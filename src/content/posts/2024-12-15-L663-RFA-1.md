We were contacted by a workshop who required our services to program and configure a brand new RFA purchased from the dealer after the original RFA was stolen which rendered the keyless and remote functions inoperative.

As these newer JLR models require the dealer equipment to be able to program most of the modules, and that we have the equipment - we first ran a diagnostic scan to make sure the new RFA and all other modules were communicating, however, the new RFA did not respond to the network calls.

Upon further inspection and wiring integrity testing, the 5A fuse that supplies the RFA was blown, after replacing the fuse, we were able to communicate with the new RFA.

As programming on all modern vehicles requires a quality battery maintainer, we hooked our trusted maintainer and went ahead with programming the new RFA.

Also, to note - when programming a new RFA, 2 or more working or new keys are required to be programmed.
The workshop was informed and the 2 working keys were brought to us.

As the program begun with the procedure, the BCM also required an update, and was also updated to the latest level possible (an added bonus the client received).

After the RFA programming routine completed, the remote and keyless began to operate and no longer required the key to be put under the steering column.

The client (workshop) was delighted to have the keyless and remote functions restored.
