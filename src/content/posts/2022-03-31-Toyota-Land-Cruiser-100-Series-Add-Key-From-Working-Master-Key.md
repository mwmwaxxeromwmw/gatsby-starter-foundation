One of our clients contacted us to make a spare key from his working master key, usually when all keys are lost, different approaches to decode the key's bitting are used, in this case, the master key contained what was needed to be decoded.

We measured the key's surface which was around 2.5MM, whereas other 100 series keys are 3MM, this is not a big issue theoretically but when the key is being cut, different machines and tools determine depth, spaces and bittings with different settings and methods.

With that in mind, our tool automatically detected the appropriate settings and decoded the master key's bittings to make a valid key, other tools may require a wedge or shim to even out the 2.5-3MM spacing when cutting the key after it has been decoded.

A blank key was pre-ordered by our client to cut costs and we used the very same key to cut with the decoded bits from the original master key. Since the key contained transponder information and a remote, extra charges would've applied to program another remote and transponder, to cut costs the client decided to put the old remote and transponder in the new key/casing.
