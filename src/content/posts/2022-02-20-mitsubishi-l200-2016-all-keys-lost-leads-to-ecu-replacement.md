A Mitsubishi L200 that had all its keys lost and a failed attempt at key programming by fellow local locksmiths resulted in the original ECU being bricked due to the failed programming attempt, we were called to the rescue after the mess was done, and Moks Auto always cleans their mess.

Since the original ECU was dead beyond possible repair, we ordered a replacement ECU by chassis number, once it arrived, the car would not start (of course) because the ECU needs to be programmed to the vehicle's immobilizer, we succeeded at doing so but the keys were still not programmed.

We then programmed the keys with the proper equipment, and the vehicle is back on the road now.
