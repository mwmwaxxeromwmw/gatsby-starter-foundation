We were called to diagnose a Mini Cooper 2012 model with a complaint of ABS, traction and handbrake lights in cluster stay on.

Our initial fault code scan revealed a fault: 5DB3 - relating to the DSC/lateral acceleration sensor, this is a relatively common fault on BMWs and Minis that we have experienced.

Due to our experience with lateral acceleration sensor faults, we knew exactly how to tackle this problem, instead of replacing the sensor, we repair them and recalibrate them which reduces our client's waiting time and costs.

After repairing the sensor and recalibrating the lateral acceleration on the vehicle with our advanced tools, the fault 5DB3 was no more and all the lights in the cluster also vanished.

The client was filled with joy as other shops were unable to diagnose it and had thrown unnecessary parts in hopes to fix the problem.
