A fellow local locksmith contacted us for a problem on a W204 with a no ignition, no crank, no start symptom, which is typical when the key or the electronic steering lock/ESL is defective, the locksmith had already ruled out the problem which was the defective ESL.

Since the problem was already identified, the ESL was opened and it was detected that the motor that locks and unlocks the steering was defective and needed replacing, since we don't stock on motors, we have ESL emulators that are less buggy compared to factory ESLs that get defective over time.

The locksmith agreed on installing an emulator as the customer did not want to have this problem again. We programmed the emulator using the existing key and EIS which were brought to us and then installed back on the vehicle with the emulator we programmed. 

The customer has had no problems after installing the emulator.
