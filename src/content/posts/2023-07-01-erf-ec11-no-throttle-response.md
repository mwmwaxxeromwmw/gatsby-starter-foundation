We were called to diagnose a ERF EC11 which uses a Cummins based engine, the complaint was - no throttle response after the engine control unit was replaced due to the old control unit being stolen.

The client tried multiple working accelerator pedals but the issue was still not resolved.

Our initial diagnostic did not reveal any promising fault codes, but through experience, we know that most Cummins based systems use different accelerator control systems, so we knew that the replacement control module was not matching with the actual configuration of the truck and needed proper programming to be performed.

We flashed and calibrated the replacement ECM successfully and the truck started accelerating instantly.

Yet another satisfied client!
