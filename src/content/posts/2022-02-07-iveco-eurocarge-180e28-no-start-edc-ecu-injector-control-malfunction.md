We were called to diagnose an Iveco Eurocargo through referral from one of our satisfied clients, the symptom on this particular truck was, it would not start at all, before touching any delicate parts or modules, we first scanned for fault codes.

The fault codes referred to all 6 injectors having an open or short circuit, we checked through the wiring to the ECM, and it all checked out, it is quite strange for all 6 injectors to have a short or open circuit all at once.

Usually, the above control unit is culprit to such faults, as the truck ages, so do its delicate parts such as the above control unit, the control unit was opened and inspected for any wear & tear and indeed the control unit itself was faulty.

A used working control unit was purchased, which was then programmed on bench by us. The truck starts with no fault codes whatsoever.
