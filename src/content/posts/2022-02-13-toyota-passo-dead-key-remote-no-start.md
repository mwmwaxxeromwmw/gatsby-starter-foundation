A Toyota Passo equipped with the 4D type keyless remote was brought to us with intermittent no starts due to the remote suffering physical and internal damage, which made the vehicle's immobilizer to sometimes recognize the key and not recognize at other more prominent times.

We first diagnosed the vehicle, and found no fault codes in any modules regarding the remote/key, then we attempted to read the key with a proper smart key tester, which pointed out that the key was not operating properly, and should be replaced.

We programmed a replacement key via OBD, and the vehicle is starting up without any problems whatsoever.
