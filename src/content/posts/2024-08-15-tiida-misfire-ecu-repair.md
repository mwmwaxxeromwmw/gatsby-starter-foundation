A 2009 Nissan Tiida HR15 was brought to us with a misfire complaint.

Upon diagnosis and visual inspectipon, it was found that ignition coil number 3 was not firing.

After performing additional tests such as wiring integrity, checking powers, grounds and signal, we discovered the coil triggering signal was missing.

As we have experience with this issue, it was easy to point to a faulty ECU.

On our bench, we tested and confirmed once again the ECU was defective.

Once we traced the components that were faulty, we replaced them and tested the ECU on the vehicle. 

The misfire was now gone, and preventive service was performed - we replaced all spark plugs and ignition coil #3.
