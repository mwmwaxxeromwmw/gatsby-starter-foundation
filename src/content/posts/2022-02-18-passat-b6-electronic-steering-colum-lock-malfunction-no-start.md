We were called to a passat with a defective steering column lock that prevented the vehicle to start, it would start up for 3 seconds and die right up, our initial diagnosis was done through vag's OEM tool Odis, which pointed out that the immobilizer did not recognize the steering lock.

Just through this fault code alone it was safe to say that the SCL itself was defective, causing the vehicle to become immobilized and needed replacing, the client was informed about the situation and a replacement SCL was ordered through the vehicle's chassis number.

Once the SCL arrived, it was then taught in and coded to the vehicle's immobilizer system, the car runs just fine now.
