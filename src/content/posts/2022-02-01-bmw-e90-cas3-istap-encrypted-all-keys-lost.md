We were called to a BMW 320i with an all keys lost situation, in this case, it was not so simple to make keys as the CAS (immobiliser) module was encrypted, we had to extract data from the DME to be able to decrypt the CAS and make keys.

After the CAS was read, DME data obtained, keys were successfully added and the vehicle is back on the road now.
