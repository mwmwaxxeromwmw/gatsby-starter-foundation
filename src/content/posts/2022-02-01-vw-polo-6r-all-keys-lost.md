We were called to a VW POLO 6R model which had an all keys lost situation, the client had given the job to amateurs who were not able to complete the immobilizer pairing process, the complaint was - the vehicle would start and immediatrly cut off, windows did not operate and the insrument cluster displayed 'SAFE' which meant the vehicle was immobilized.

We discovered the immobilizer data was corrupted and would not allow the key to be paired, the customer was informed and we had to recover the data on bench, after recovery, we did the pairing process on vehicle.

The client was satisfied with our work.
