We were called to diagnose a VW golf MK7 with a low power symptom a few days after the vehicle was tuned by a noob tuner, upon diagnosis and inspection it was found the turbo was defetive due to overboosting by the wrong tune. The client purchased a used working turbo and requested the original map file to be restored.

We removed the ECU from the vehicle and recovered the map file on bench.

The turbo was also replaced, vehicle was tested and performed well. The client was satisfied with our work.
