We were called to diagnose a Nissan Note DBA-E12 2012 model equipped with the HR12-DE Jetronic engine, which had a no ignition, no crank, no start symptom along with no security lamp indication in the combination meter.

As always, we first scan for fault codes, which resulted with a plethora of fault codes mainly in the IPDM and BCM, even though we didn't have communication with the TCM and ECM due to no ignition.

Next, we actuated ignition through the BCM which resulted in the cluster lighting up and pointing that the BCM itself was sending and receiving ignition signal but was not the culprit for the no ignition symptom, the key itself was read out and belonged to the vehicle, live data stream was also read out of the ignition switch/push button and it was found that the NATS antenna amplifier was defective since it was not detecting a key.

The client was informed of the situation and a new push button with NATS amplifier was ordered, but still this did not resolve the problem as the vehicle had been through other hands who damaged the synchronization between the security modules on the vehicle. 

Since the vehicle had been through other hands, the BCM, ECM and ESL lost synchronization, we performed the sync using the proper equipment, after sync, the security lamp indicator automatically actuated and the vehicle is back on the road now.
