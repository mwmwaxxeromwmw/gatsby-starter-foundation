We were contacted by a client who lost the keys for his W204 C200.

As we have the required equipment to perform this job within a few minutes, the client requested to have it done onsite.

We started off by removing the EIS and using our bench harness to collect immobilizer data.

This process took less than 20 minutes as we had the bypass adapters.

Once the immobilizer data was collected and analyzed to extract the password, new keys were then programmed to the EIS.

The client was delighted to have his car running within 30 minutes.
