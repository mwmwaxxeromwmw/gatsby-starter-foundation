We were called to diagnose a Hino Coaster with the N04C engine, the client's complaint was low power.

Our diagnostic concluded that the vehicle had not been manually regenerated since purchase time, the client was informed and educated on the topic of manually forced regenration.

Upon the first few regen attempts, the power was back!
