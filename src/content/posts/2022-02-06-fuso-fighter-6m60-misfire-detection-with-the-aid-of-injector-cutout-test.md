A Mitsubishi Fuso Fighter equipped with the 6M60 engine was brought to us which had a misfire and poor acceleration/hesitation when put under load, we scanned for fault codes and no obvious faults were recorded by the engine control unit.

Since there were no relevant fault codes, but still the truck would misbehave, often times injector codes are not set on these models, we checked for fuel pressure using live data and a manometer which checked out.

Now that we know fuel supply to the injectors is just fine, it's time to check the injectors themselves, we did a computerized injector cutout test to know which cylinder's injector is misbehaving, there were no changes at cylinder 2 and 4, which wrapped up our diagnostic.

Wiring between the ECM and injectors were checked and resistance at the injectors was tested as well, the values fluctuated from their neighboring working injectors which meant that the injectors needed to be replaced.

Injectors were bought from the dealers and coded to the vehicle, the truck performs like brand new now.
