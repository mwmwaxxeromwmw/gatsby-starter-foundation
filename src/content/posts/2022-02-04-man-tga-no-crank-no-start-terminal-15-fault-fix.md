We were called to diagnose a MAN TGA 2011 truck which had a symptom where it would cut off randomly and only start after multiple hours.

We discovered that the EDC would not communicate when this problem would occur, we had to be quick with our diagnostic work as the nature of the fault was intermittent, upon inspection of powers and grounds, it was discovered 1 terminal 15 was missing, hence the vehicle would not start as the EDC was not seeing ignition on.

Wiring was tested and corrosion/breakage was found and repaired, the vehicle is back on the road now.
