A Mercedes Benz GLC250 came to us with a check engine light that was intermittent but did not affect overall engine performance, the vehicle was scanned for fault codes using Mercedes' dealer tool - Xentry and the engine had a fault code "P06DA00", Mercedes' advisory/TSB states this fault code is to be ignored and erased, but this does not help much since it flags an intermittent check engine light.

A thorough inspection was done using Xentry by looking at "actual values" combined with physical inspection, and it was found out that the wiring to the oil pump valve/solenoid was faulty, and shorting to ground, which makes more sense since the check engine light was intermittent, every time the wire(s) shorted, it would trigger the check engine light. 

The repair consisted of properly soldering and insulating the worn out wiring, which seemed to solve the intermittent fault.
