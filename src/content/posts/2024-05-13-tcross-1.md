We were contacted by a client with a VW T-cross whose complaint was - no ignition response when start button is pressed.

As we have the dealer equipment and know-how for VAG, we first diagnosed the vehicle and found that the steering column lock was not communicating with the start authorisation module.

Now that we have a path as to why the ignition was not coming on, we inspected the wiring for the steering column lock which checked out fine.

This meant that the steering column lock itself was defective.

The client was informed of our findings and ordered a brand new ESCL direct from CFAO.

As we have the dealer equipment, this steering column lock requires to be programmed online, which we programmed successfully.

The client was delighted to have his vehicle correctly diagnosed and repaired.
