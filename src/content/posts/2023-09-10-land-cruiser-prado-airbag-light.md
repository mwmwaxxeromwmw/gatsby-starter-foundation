We were called to diagnose a Land Cruiser Prado with a complaint of a permanently on airbag/SRS light in the cluster.

Our initial diagnstic revealed the airbag control module had no diagnostic communication and was not communicating with the rest of the modules hence the airbag light staying constantly on.

After checking the essentials, it was found the airbag module itself had an internal fault which was causing it not to power up, we inspected the module internally and found the issue.

After, finding the culprit, we replaced the bad components from a known good module, after doing so, the module was reinstalled on the vehicle and reinitialised, after this the airbag light turned off within 5 seconds of turning on the ignition.

The customer was delighted to have his car back in shape.
