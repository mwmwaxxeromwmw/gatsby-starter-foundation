We were called to diagnose a BMW E90 320i with the N46N engine, the symptom was - no start, no ignition coil spark, no check engine light.

Our initial diagnostic revealed there was no DME communication, and also no check engine light, when we went to inspect the wiring at the DME itself, there was signs of water intrusion in the box that hold the DME, which is a common issue on these models.

Upon teardown and thorough inspection of the DME internals, there was corrosion on the circuitry beyond repair, the client was informed of the situation and a donor DME was ordered.

Once the DME arrived, we were asked to program it, and so we did the programming, coding and immobilizer pairing, after doing so, the vehicle started up!

Another satisfied client!
