We were contacted by a client all the way from Neno who had a Hino Dutro with the N04C engine and complained about a lack of power (it would not go past 2500 rpm).

Once the client agreed to bring the vehicle to us, upon visual inspection we found the DPF warning light flashing and a solid check engine light.

We ran a diagnostic and found DTC P2002 which refers to inefficiency of the DPF.

On these Dutros, with a DPF fault, the vehicle is limited to 2500 rpm so as not to exceed emissions.

The client was informed of our findings and given the option to replace the DPF with catalyst or simply delete the DPF from the engine control module which is where we specialise.

We took an ID of the ECU software, processed the software to eliminate DPF and wrote the modified file back to the truck by OBD without any disassembly.

After the ECU mapping process, we recommend and drilled a few holes in the exhaust/DPF/catalyst so as to make it free-flow, once we did the whole procedure, the vehicle instantly revved past 2500 rpm and the DPF & Check engine lights also went away. 

The client was delighted to have his truck back to normal without spending millions on a new DPF.
